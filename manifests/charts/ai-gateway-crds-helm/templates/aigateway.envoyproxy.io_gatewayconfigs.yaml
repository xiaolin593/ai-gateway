          GatewayConfig provides configuration for the AI Gateway external processor
          container that is deployed alongside the Gateway.

          A GatewayConfig is referenced by a Gateway via the annotation
          "aigateway.envoyproxy.io/gateway-config". The GatewayConfig must be in the
          same namespace as the Gateway that references it.

          This allows gateway-level configuration of the external processor, including
          environment variables (e.g., for tracing configuration) and resource requirements.

          Multiple Gateways can reference the same GatewayConfig to share configuration.

          Environment Variable Precedence:
          When merging environment variables, the following precedence applies (highest to lowest):
           1. GatewayConfig.Spec.ExtProc.Kubernetes.Env (this resource)
           2. Global controller flags (extProcExtraEnvVars)

          If the same environment variable name exists in both sources, the GatewayConfig
          value takes precedence.
